# Footer Investigation Findings

## Problem
- Two identical Footer components are being rendered on the main page
- Footer 1: Inside main page div (shouldn't be there)
- Footer 2: Direct child of body (shouldn't be there)

## Investigation Results

### Main Page Analysis
- `src/app/page.tsx` does NOT import Footer component
- Main page only imports: Header, SpiritualArtwork, useTranslation
- No Footer references found in main page file

### Layout Analysis  
- `src/app/layout.tsx` does NOT include Footer component
- Layout only includes: StructuredData, LanguageProvider, floating buttons

### Component Analysis
- Header component: No Footer references
- SpiritualArtwork component: No Footer references  
- LanguageContext: No Footer references
- StructuredData: No Footer references

### Browser Investigation
- Both footers have React fiber keys (rendered by React)
- Footer 1 is sibling of HEADER and MAIN in main page div
- Footer 2 is direct child of body
- React component tree shows both as legitimate React components

## Hypothesis
There must be some component that's:
1. Adding Footer to main page div dynamically
2. Adding Footer to body globally
3. Being rendered twice somehow

## Next Steps
- Check for any dynamic Footer rendering
- Look for any component that might be duplicating Footer
- Check for any global Footer mechanism
