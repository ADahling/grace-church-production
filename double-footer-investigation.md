# Double Footer Investigation

## Problem
There are 2 identical Footer components being rendered on the Grace Church website:
1. One inside the main page div (parentElement: DIV)
2. One directly in the body (parentElement: BODY)

## Investigation Findings

### Code Analysis
- Layout.tsx correctly imports and renders Footer component once
- Main page (page.tsx) does NOT import or render Footer component
- No other components import Footer component
- No dynamic imports or conditional rendering of Footer found

### Browser Console Results
- `document.querySelectorAll('footer').length` returns 2
- One footer has parentElement 'DIV.min-h-screen...'
- One footer has parentElement 'BODY'
- Both footers have identical className and content

### Temporary Fix Test
- Removing footer from main div via console eliminated the duplication
- Only one clean footer remained at bottom

## Hypothesis
There appears to be a React hydration or rendering issue where:
1. Footer is correctly rendered by layout.tsx in body
2. Something is causing an additional Footer to be rendered inside the main page div
3. This could be a Next.js SSR/hydration mismatch or component duplication bug

## Next Steps
- Need to identify what's causing the Footer to render inside main div
- Likely requires examining the compiled/built output or React component tree
- May need to force a clean rebuild to resolve caching issues
